= Backup and extract kindle clippings to GitHub using GitHub Actions
:toc:

Backup and extract your kindle notes in a semi-automatic fashion using GitHub actions.

== Description

Amazon kindles store all highlightings - both from ebooks purchased with Amazon and documents transferred to the kindle in other ways - in the file `/documents/My Clippings.txt`.

Each marking consists of four lines, for example:

[source]
----
==========
The Tao Te Ching (Lao Tzu)
- Ihre Markierung bei Position 22-23 | Hinzugef√ºgt am Donnerstag, 14. Juni 2018 23:06:53 <1>

Practice not-doing, and everything will fall into place.
========== <2>
----
<1> Here the kindle is set to German so the position and timestamp line is also in German; but during parsing the information from this line isn't extracted anyways so it should work for every language.
<2> Annotation entries are separated by bars consisting of 10 `=`.

This repository presents a semi-automatic tool which backups the `My Clippings.txt` file, extracts the annotations and merges them with the previous one (if the `My Clippings.txt` is reset no quotes are lost). In the last step the annotations are formatted with Markdown and separated by book and pushed to a human-friendly branch for reading.

Implemented using GitHub actions and a simple Python script.

This is only semi-automatic as I know of no simple way to extract the `My Clippings.txt` from the kindle device autonomously.
To use this tool, the user has to extract the `My Clippings.txt` from the kindle by plugging it into a computer and then upload it to a repository with the scripts presented here.

Pushing something to the `master` branch (if you use this as intended, this would be a new version of the `My Clippings.txt`) triggers the following GitHub actions:

- separate notes from different books using a script (don't know which one yet) in a temporary branch
- merge this temporary branch with the files in the `notes` branch

The `notes` branch is the end result - here you can read, edit and delete the annotations.
If your `My Clippings.txt` is reset, all new notes will be appended to the existing notes, nothing will be lost.

This tool uses three branches:

- `master`: contains the scripts and is the place where the user inputs his `My Clippings.txt`
- `store`: Keeps a backup of all quotes, in case the `My Clippings.txt` is truncated.
- `notes`: This is the place where the nicely formatted Markdown files with the annotations are sent to - the 'output' for the user

These branch names are used in the GitHub workflow file.
If you want to use other branch names, you need to adjust them there.

== Setup

This section describes how to set up this tool.

=== 1. Clone or copy files
First you need to copy the relevant files.
There are two ways to do this, by copying the relevant files manually or by using the GitHub template (recommended).
- *Using the template*: Press "Use this template", enter a name and tick the checkbox `Include all branches`. To get all branches from the master run `git fetch --all`.
- *Copying the files*: Create a new repository and copy all the files from the `master` branch into the new repositories `master` branch.

=== 2. Set up the branches
To work, the remote GitHub repository needs to have a `master` branch with the script files as well as empty and related `store` and `notes` branches.
Check which branches your new repository has with `git branch`.

If you are missing the `store` and `notes` branches, you can create them with the following commands:

[source,bash]
----
git checkout --orphan notes
# delete and unstage all files in the directory, e.g. with:
git rm -rf .
rm .gitignore
git commit --allow-empty -m "init notes branch"
git push origin notes
git checkout -b store
git commit --allow-empty -m "init store branch"
git push origin store
git checkout master
----

If you, for whatever reason, want to start fresh you can always reset everything by removing the `store` and `notes` branches (e.g. with `git push origin --delete notes` and `git branch -D notes`).

=== 3. Paste in your `My Clippings.txt` file from the kindle
Connect your kindle to your computer.
Open the `/documents` directory on the kindle.
Overwrite the `My Clippings.txt` file in the `master` branch with the `My Clippings.txt` file from `/documents`, commit the change and push it to GitHub.

=== 4. Update
If there are changes in this template repository and you would like to update your instance, you do this by either updating the files in the `master` branch with the ones from this repository (except `My Clippings.txt`).

If you used the "Use this template" method to create your clone, follow the instructions here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56577184/github-pull-changes-from-a-template-repository

== How to use
- Set up the repository as described above
- After that, iteratively:
** Upload your current version of `My Clippings.txt` from your kindle to the `master` branch (replace the previous version) and commit it
** The GitHub action is then triggered and merges new annotations to the `notes` branch
** Switch to the `notes` branch and review your annotations

== Support
If you find any bugs, please submit an issue here.
Also if you find a simple way to automatically export `My Clippings.txt` from kindle devices, please submit an issue so I may implement it.
If you like this tool, consider leaving a star.

If you want to change the output (i.e. use a different kind of markup), the easiest way would be to clone this repository and edit `process.py`.
