= Backup and extract kindle clippings to GitHub using GitHub Actions
:toc:

Backup and extract your kindle notes in a semi-automatic fashion using GitHub actions.

== Description

Amazon kindles store all highlightings - both from ebooks purchased with Amazon and documents transferred to the kindle in other ways - in the file `/documents/My Clippings.txt`.

Each marking consists of four lines, for example:

[source]
----
==========
The Tao Te Ching (Lao Tzu)
- Ihre Markierung bei Position 22-23 | Hinzugef√ºgt am Donnerstag, 14. Juni 2018 23:06:53 <1>

Practice not-doing, and everything will fall into place.

<1> Here the kindle is set to German so the position and timestamp line is also in german; but during parsing the information from this line isn't extracted anyways so it should work for every language.
<2> Annotation entries are separated by bars consisting of 10 `=`.

This repository presents a semi-automatic tool which backups the `My Clippings.txt` file, extracts the annotations and merges them with the previous one (if the `My Clippings.txt` is reset no quotes are lost). In the last step the annotations are formatted with Markdown and separated by book and pushed to a human-friendly branch for reading.

Implemented using GitHub actions and a simple Python script.

This is only semi-automatic as I know of no simple way to extract the `My Clippings.txt` from the kindle device autonomously.
To use this tool, the user has to extract the `My Clippings.txt` from the kindle by plugging it into a computer and than upload it to a repository with the scripts presented here.

, which executes the following steps every time you push a new `My Clippings.txt` in the `master` branch using github actions:
- separate notes from different books using a script (don't know which one yet) in a temporary branch
- merge this temporary branch with the files in the `notes` branch

The `notes` branch is the end result - here you can read, edit and delete the annotations.
If your `My Clippings.txt` is reset, all new notes will be appended to the existing notes, nothing will be lost.

This tool uses three branches:
- `master`: contains the scripts and is the place where the user inputs his `My Clippings.txt`
- `store`: Keeps a backup of all quotes, in case the `My Clippings.txt` is truncated.
- `notes`: This is the place where the nicely formatted Markdown files with the annotations are sent to - the 'output' for the user

These branch names are used in the GitHub workflow file.
If you want to use other branch names, you need to adjust them there.

== Setup
Clone this repository or copy the all the files from the master branch to your own repository (but replace `My Clippings.txt` with your own).

If you clone this repository, delete the `store` and `notes` branches (e.g. with `git push origin --delete notes` and `git branch -D notes`) and set them up fresh.
If you copy the files, you only need to setup these two branches.

The setup of `store` and `notes` can be done like this:

[source,bash]
----
git checkout --orphan notes
# delete and unstage all files in the directory, e.g. with:
git rm -rf .
rm .gitignore
git commit --allow-empty -m "init notes branch"
git push origin notes
git checkout -b store
git commit --allow-empty -m "init store branch"
git push origin store
git checkout master
----

== How to use
- Set up the repository as described before
- After that, iteratively:
** Upload your current version of `My Clippings.txt` from your kindle to the `master` branch (replace the previous version) and commit it
** The GitHub action is then triggered and merges new annotations to the `notes` branch
** Switch to the `notes` branch and review your annotations

== Support
If you find any bugs, please submit an issue here.
Also if you find a simple way to automatically export `My Clippings.txt` from kindle devices, please submit an issue so I may implement it.
If you like this tool, consider leaving a star.

If you want to change the output (i.e. use a different kind of markup), the easiest way would be to clone this repository and edit `process.py`.
