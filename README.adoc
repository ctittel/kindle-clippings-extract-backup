= kindle-clippings-extract-backup

This is a semi-automatic tool, which executes the following steps every time you push a new `My Clippings.txt` in the `master` branch using github actions:
- separate notes from different books using a script (don't know which one yet) in a temporary branch
- merge this temporary branch with the files in the `notes` branch

// The `notes` branch
