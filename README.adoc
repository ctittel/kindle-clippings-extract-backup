= kindle-clippings-extract-backup

This is a semi-automatic tool, which executes the following steps every time you push a new `My Clippings.txt` in the `master` branch using github actions:
- separate notes from different books using a script (don't know which one yet) in a temporary branch
- merge this temporary branch with the files in the `notes` branch

The `notes` branch is the end result - here you can read, edit and delete the annotations.
If your `My Clippings.txt` is reset, all new notes will be appended to the existing notes, nothing will be lost.
